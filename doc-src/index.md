# Supporting figures and analysis code for our two-nucleon calculation with sLapH method

[arXiv:2009.11825](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11825)

Please come back soon - our web architect had an unexpected leave of absence...

In the meantime, we have a crude site to show supporting figures for our publication.

We also have python analysis code that performs the effective range expansion analysis on github [https://github.com/laphnn/nn_c103_qcotd_swave_only](https://github.com/laphnn/nn_c103_qcotd_swave_only).
