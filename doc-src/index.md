# Supporting figures and analysis code for our two-nucleon calculation with sLapH method

We provide this website to show supporting figures for our publication recently posted on [arxiv:2009.11825](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.11825.pdf).

You can navigate this website using the buttons at the bottom of each page or jump to different pages using the sidebar menu.

We also have python analysis code that performs the effective range expansion analysis on GitHub [https://github.com/laphnn/nn_c103_qcotd_swave_only](https://github.com/laphnn/nn_c103_qcotd_swave_only).
